This paper has presented a generic privacy-preserving solution for the vast world of the Internet of Things. The IoT devices can operate as individual actors in the P2ABCE ecosystem, and when in need of performing computation offloading, the delegation server can also be a device considered into the IoT family.
Our PoC implementation demonstrates that this project is actually feasible in constrained devices, not by performing a simulation of an IoT device, like in \cite{vanet} or \cite{alcaide2013anonymous}, but deploying it in a real IoT device.

On the design aspect, we mentioned a P2ABCE API to abstract the delegation process to other processes running in the IoT devices. To develop this API we should study the available solutions to decide how to delegate to the server, e.g. using REST, CoAP, RPC, and consider the security issues mentioned in previous sections. Then, we can define an standard API and implement it assuring a great level of trust in the technique.
On the implementation side, it would be interesting to compare the execution of the current PoC to a version with cryptographic hardware acceleration, for example, using Atmel's chips for SHA, AES and secure memory.
