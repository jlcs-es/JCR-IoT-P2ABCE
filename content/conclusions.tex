This paper has presented a generic privacy-preserving solution for the vast world of the Internet of Things. The IoT devices can operate as individual actors in the P2ABCE ecosystem, and when in need of performing computation offloading, the delegation server can also be a device considered into the IoT family.
The PoC implementation demonstrates that this project is actually feasible in constrained devices, not by performing a simulation of an IoT device, like in \cite{vanet} or \cite{alcaide2013anonymous}, but deploying it in a real IoT scenario.

On the design aspect, it was mentioned a P2ABCE API to abstract the delegation process to other processes running in the IoT devices. To develop this API it is first necessary to study the available solutions for delegation, e.g. using REST, CoAP, RPC, and for the security issues mentioned in previous sections. After agreeing in the solutions to take, an standard API can be defined. 
On the implementation side, it would be interesting to compare the execution of the current PoC to a version with cryptographic hardware acceleration, for example, using Atmel's chips for SHA, AES and secure memory.
