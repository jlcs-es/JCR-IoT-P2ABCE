\begin{abstract}
The pervasive nature of Internet of Things entails additional threats that compromise the security and privacy of IoT devices and, eventually, the users. This issue is aggravated in constrained IoT devices equipped with minimal hardware resources. Current security and privacy implementations need to be re-designed and implemented maintaining its LoA, aiming for this family of devices. To cope with this issue, this paper proposes the first novel attempt to leverage Anonymous Credential Systems (ACS) to preserve the privacy of autonomous IoT constrained devices. Concretely, we have designed a solution to integrate IBM's Identity Mixer into constrained IoT ecosystems, endowing the IoT with ACS's privacy-preserving capabilities. The solution has been designed, implemented and evaluated proving its feasibility.
