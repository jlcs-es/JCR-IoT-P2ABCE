\begin{abstract}
The pervasive nature of Internet of Things entails additional threats that compromise the security and privacy of IoT devices and, eventually, the users. This issue is aggravated in constrained IoT devices equipped with minimal hardware resources. Current security and privacy implementations need to be re-designed and implemented maintaining its LoA, aiming for this family of devices. To cope with this issue, this paper proposes the first novel attempt to leverage Anonymous Credential Systems (ACS) to preserve the privacy of autonomous IoT constrained devices. Concretely, we have designed a solution to integrate IBM's Identity Mixer into constrained IoT ecosystems, endowing the IoT with ACS's privacy-preserving capabilities. The solution has been designed, implemented and evaluated proving its feasibility.

%\begin{IEEEbiography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{a1.png}}]{First A. Author} (M'76--SM'81--F'87) and all authors may include 
%biographies. Biographies are often not included in conference-related
%papers. This author became a Member (M) of IEEE in 1976, a Senior
%Member (SM) in 1981, and a Fellow (F) in 1987. The first paragraph may
%contain a place and/or date of birth (list place, then date). Next,
%the author's educational background is listed. The degrees should be
%listed with type of degree in what field, which institution, city,
%state, and country, and year the degree was earned. The author's major
%field of study should be lower-cased. 
%
%The second paragraph uses the pronoun of the person (he or she) and not the 
%author's last name. It lists military and work experience, including summer 
%and fellowship jobs. Job titles are capitalized. The current job must have a 
%location; previous positions may be listed 
%without one. Information concerning previous publications may be included. 
%Try not to list more than three books or published articles. The format for 
%listing publishers of a book within the biography is: title of book 
%(publisher name, year) similar to a reference. Current and previous research 
%interests end the paragraph. The third paragraph begins with the author's 
%title and last name (e.g., Dr.\ Smith, Prof.\ Jones, Mr.\ Kajor, Ms.\ Hunter). 
%List any memberships in professional societies other than the IEEE. Finally, 
%list any awards and work for IEEE committees and publications. If a 
%photograph is provided, it should be of good quality, and 
%professional-looking. Following are two examples of an author's biography.
